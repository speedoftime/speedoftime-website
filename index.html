    <h1>The Speed of Time Theory</h1>
    <h2>A Field-Based Framework for Causality and Quantum Gravity</h2>

    <p>This website introduces the "Speed of Time Theory," a novel framework proposing that time is not merely a passive parameter, but a deeper, causally prior structure. We suggest that time functions as a dynamic rate of causal resolution, enabling meaningful transitions within a system even before light can spatially propagate. This theory reframes fundamental concepts of causality, distance, and quantum superposition.</p>

        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>Our preliminary paper, "Time Is Faster Than Light: Rethinking Causality, Speed, and Superposition," is currently undergoing the endorsement process for submission to arXiv. We anticipate it will be publicly available soon.</p>
        </div>

    <h3>What's Next</h3>
    <p>Once our preliminary paper is released on arXiv, a direct link will be provided here. In the future, this site will host detailed explanations of the theory's mathematical framework, further research, and ongoing developments of the Speed of Time Theory.</p>
